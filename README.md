# MazeGeneratorAndSolver
The maze solver and generator will only work using VMWare, a virtual machine used to code in C++ at school.
This code provides a depth-first algorithm to create and generate a maze, starting from a X by Y rectangular box,
breaking down each wall until a perfect maze with a unique solution is generated.
The maze solver also uses a similar depth-first algorithm to find that unique solution.
